## Build process

CloudFormation templates are generated by the build process.  Python or Javascript code to
appear in the templates must be encoded in JSON, and the process of encoding the source 
code and inserting it into the template is automated.  This process depends on dot, a
template engine for Javascript (https://olado.github.io/doT/index.html).
